# SATORI Development Workflow

Defines standard practices for local dev, GitHub use, and releases.

---

## Local Development
- Use **LocalWP** + VS Code.  
- Each plugin lives in its own repo.  
- Use `SATORI-STANDARDS.md` as coding reference.  

---

## Git Workflow
- `main` → stable release branch.  
- `dev` → active branch.  
- Feature branches → merge into `dev` via PR.  
- Tag versions when merging into `main`.  

---

## Documentation
- All repos include `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.  
- Keep synced with **satori-suite-docs** repo.

---

## AI Tools
- GitHub Copilot allowed for boilerplate, must follow `COPILOT.md`.  
- ChatGPT used for architecture, reviews, scaffolding.
